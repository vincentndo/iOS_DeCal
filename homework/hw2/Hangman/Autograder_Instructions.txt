1. Run Autograder.dmg and drag "iOS DeCal Autograder" into your Mac's Applications folder (important).
2. Open the assignment you want to grade in Xcode.
3. Launch the "iOS DeCal Autograder" application (the one we moved in step 1), and click "Grade".
4. Upon successfully grading, it will notify you and output a .token file in your project directory (where your .xcodeproj file is).
5. Upload just the .token file to Gradescope.
